I am a Data Analyst and AI both **`Machine learning`** & **`Deep learning`** passionate Engineer. I love programming, and I've been studying and doing projects on these topics for **`over 2 years`**.

As a Data analyst, I enjoy visualizing all patterns & trends in data, unlike what most people say, **data is not a bunch of numbers** :red_circle:, au contraire. **`Data reveals the truth that can't be hidden`**. Using the powers of programming (Specially **`Python` Programming** :snake:) I can drill into the data to extract every hidden truth. And what's data without Database and commmunication! Here when it comes to using **`SQL`**. Merging the powers of both I am very confident to say that I can do magic :crystal_ball:

#### Talking about Personal Stuffs:
- :office: **I'm looking for a job opportunity**. (**FyI: I am a fresh graduate**)
- :art: Currently learning **more and more** about **`Data Structures & Algorithms`** on **[Leetcode](www.leetcode.com)**. That's what I call **`Programming Art`**.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: The better visualization the better insights it delivers. That's why I am improving my skills in **`Power Bi`** on **[DataCamp](www.datacamp.com) Platform**.
- :books: For over **`2 years`** I've never stopped learning more about AI, that's why I continuously enchance my skills while learning/applying about:
  - AI Powerful Libraries (**`Numpy`**, **`Pandas`**, **`Matplotlib`**, **`Seaborn`**, **`Scikit-learn`**)
  - **Machine Learning (Theory/Practice):** (**`Regression`**, **`Classification`**, **`Clustesring`**)
  - **Deep Learning (Theory/Practice):**
    - **Artificial Neural Networks** theory and recent practices using **`Keras`** & **`Tensorflow`**.
    - **Computer vision** (Classic / state-of-the-art) approaches using [**`OpenCV`**, **`PIL`**, **`Convlutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`**]
    - **Natural Language Processing** using (**`Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)`**, **`Sequence Models`** basics, and looking forward to learning more about **`Sequence models`** and **`Transformers`**.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about anything, I am always happy to help.
